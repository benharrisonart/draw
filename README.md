## Converting sound to colors


Seeing Music As Color 
sounds to light conversions

3 notes, each on a color wheel and circle of fifths 
- program each chord to show the colors 


it will generate up to 3 tones 
- and each will have a colored light shining on a single surface.. 
- mixed together to show colors of sounds and chords.

show the relationship between color waves and sound waves
- why some sounds together are dissonant 
- does that happen with color the same way, for the same reasons
